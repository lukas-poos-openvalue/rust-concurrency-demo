# Rust Concurrency for Java Devs (WIP)
This repository contains all code examples for the block article (Rust Concurrency for Java Devs)[TODO].

## Example Overview

1. Java Race Condition
1. Rust Race Condition
1. Rust Basic Data Structures
1. Rust Solution

## Executing the Examples

### Online Playgrounds
For Java, just paste an example here: (Java Playground)[https://code.sololearn.com/java].
For Rust, just paste an example here: (Rust Playground)[https://play.rust-lang.org/].

### Run Java Example Locally
The Java example does not have any dependencies outside of a JRE, hence only an installed JRE is required (at least Version 8). I recommend to use an IDE like IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code etc. with the JRE set up to run the example.

With a Java IDE set up and running, use the IDE's Java runner to execute the code.

### Run Rust Examples Locally
In order to compile and run Rust projects, you need some Rust tools such as rustc or cargo.
The entire Rust environment can be installed using the (rustup installer)[https://rustup.rs/].

After installing rustup, I recommend to use and IDE like VS Code with Rust extensions installed to run the example.

With a Rust IDE set up and running, use the extension's runner functionalities to execute the code.
In order to compile and execute an example, copy the example code into the main.rs file and run it either
with the intellisense "run"-command or via the "cargo run" command.
